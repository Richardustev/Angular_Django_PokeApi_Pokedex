## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project (where the package.json file is located).

2. Run the following command:
```Bash
npm install
```

## Running the Project
1. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Angular development server using this command:
```Bash
ng serve
```

This will compile the application and launch it on a local server, typically at http://localhost:4200, so you can view and test your project in a web browser.
